The objective operates at the token level, which results in a different algorithm due to the presence of KL divergence. The risk is calculated sequentially in terms of the deviation between the model and a reference model on the token level.\nMy derivation shows that the notorious partition function will cancel in the general setting, akin to the more specific setting studied by the DPO paper.\nI argue that state augmentation is essential, particularly for token-level generation in LLM alignment. The inherent contextual dependencies of text tasks and the non-Markovian characteristics of risk sensitivity naturally necessitate this approach.\n\nCompared to DPO-style methods, my technique introduces negligible additional complexity and computational overhead.\nMy experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm maintains a similar level of preference accuracy relative to a recent benchmark,\nwhile having a lower divergence relative to the reference policy.
